# React BMI Calculator

This project is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built with React. It allows users to enter their height and weight values, calculates their BMI, and displays the result on the screen.

## Project Features

- Input fields for entering height (feet and inches) and weight (pounds).
- Calculation of BMI based on the entered values.
- Display of the calculated BMI result.
- Ability to clear the input fields by pressing the Enter key.
- Responsive design for a better user experience on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styling language for designing the user interface.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. Open the project in your web browser.
5. Enter your height and weight values in the provided input fields.
6. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to calculate your BMI.
7. Press the Enter key to clear the input fields.
8. View the calculated BMI result on the screen.

Feel free to modify and customize the project according to your needs. Happy coding!

## Learning Points

During the development of this project, I have gained knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- Working with React components, state, and props.
- Handling user input and updating state based on input changes.
- Performing calculations based on the entered values.
- Conditional rendering to display the calculated result.
- Event handling and handling key presses.
- Responsive design principles for creating a user-friendly interface.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some possible future enhancements for the BMI Calculator:

- Improve the styling and layout of the user interface.
- Add validation to ensure that only valid numeric values are entered.
- Implement a range indicator to provide context for the calculated BMI result (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.).
- Allow users to switch between different unit systems (e.g., metric and imperial).
- Store and display a history of previously calculated BMI results.
